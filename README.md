# Speech-Activity-Detection-SAD
This repository hosts a custom-developed Speech Activity Detection (SAD) model, designed to accurately identify periods of speech and silence within audio signals. Leveraging cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) techniques, our SAD model is optimized for "real-time applications", "low-resource devices", "noisy environments", etc.
